# AMdEX_AF-KLM_Demo
This repository contains the code used in my demonstration for Air France - KLM on the 17th of January 2023.
The demo was part of the [AMDeX project](https://amdex.eu/) and was also recorded, the link can be found [here]().
The demo is related to my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/PepijndeReus/ThesisAI), supervised by [Ana Oprescu](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/o/p/a.m.oprescu/a.m.oprescu.html).

## Requirements
The following packages should be installed before running the code:
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [DataSynthesizer](https://pypi.org/project/DataSynthesizer/)
- [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)

## How to run the code
Once you've pulled this GitHub repository, open jupyter notebook via the terminal.
Then you should be able to run all notebooks at once. Please note that we only included the necessary data files, feel free to reach out for other measurements of our experiment!

Here is a link to [an instruction by Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks) if you're new to jupyter notebooks.
